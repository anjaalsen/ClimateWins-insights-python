# ClimateWins-Insights-Python
## Introduction
The NGO ClimateWins is exploring the use of machine learning to better understand and predict the consequences of climate change. 
As a small organization with limited resources, it relies on innovative approaches to analyze complex climate patterns. 
This project aims to develop data-driven insights that can support climate adaptation and decision-making.

## Research Hypoteses
- Higher sunshine duration and lower cloud cover increase the likelihood of pleasant weather  
- Higher temperatures in summer months increase the frequency of pleasant weather, except in extremely hot regions    
- Wet conditions reduce the chances of pleasant weather  

## Data Set
The dataset used contains daily weather observations from 18 European stations spanning from the 1960s to 2022.  
It includes variables like temperature, wind speed, snow depth, and radiation, collected by the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) project for climate analysis and predictions.

## Methods
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  
- Data preprocessing: Scaling, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning  
- Performance evaluation: Confusion matrices, accuracy comparison
